## Questions for me
#### Q. how sperm is made? is it made from blood?
Blood brings nutrition and oxygen to the testicles.  
That makes the germinal stem cells in the testicles able to divide and mature into sperm cells.

#### Q. Does prostate cancer risk high if not masturbate?
There’s exciting news on the prostate cancer front. If you ejaculate frequently, your risk of getting prostate cancer may be reduced. How often is frequent? A study at Harvard Medical School says [21 timesTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15069045) a month. A similar Australian [studyTrusted Source](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04319.x/full) points to seven times a week.
